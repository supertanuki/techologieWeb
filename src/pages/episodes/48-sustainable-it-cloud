Natalie has worked with teams moving to the Cloud. She talks about how the Cloud can help reduce the environmental impact of IT but customers need to be able to measure and track their digital footprint too.

As a Product Manager, she shares examples for how to design and measure products for Sustainability, and not only rely on offsetting emissions.

She talks about how IT solutions can help companies become greener across many industries, but we also need to balance the growing environmental footprint of IT particularly with AI/ML and blockchain.
